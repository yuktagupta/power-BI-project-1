Hello, Connections!!

This is my first Dashboard in Power BI.

Please review and suggest the mistakes that need to be corrected and how i can make it better.

I've created this dashboard using #PowerBI. This is a guided project from Rishabh Mishra You tube channel on "Madhav E-Commerce Sales Dashboard".

Objective: The owner of Raghav Store wants to help them create a dashboard to track and analyze their online sales across India.

My learning from this project are:
1. Created an interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data
2. Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers
3. Created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user-driven parameters for visualizations
4. Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers, etc)


Overall, the guided project was a great learning experience and learned the potential of Power BI as a powerful tool for creating effective dashboards.

Kindly review, and share your thoughts, I do respect your feedback.
